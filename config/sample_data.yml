        man and time is go out and meet new friends is not as much as I would like.
        I am interested in a fun person that I can share some private time with.

    general_info_description: Well what can I say. I'm 28 years young, living life one day at a
      time!!! Have been living back in Miami for a few years now since graduating
      college and can't say I want to leave. I love the beach, meeting fun and interesting
      people, and enjoying all the cool little spots the city has to offer.

    date_preferences_description: This is a tough one, some dates have gone really well. Some not so
        much. Definitely depends on chemistry! Other than that I would say the perfect
        date would be a mix between a nice dinner somewhere (preferably somewhere outdoors
        or by the water) and a night out with some music in the background and upbeat
        vibe (Say the shoreclub on a Friday).

    general_info_description: Here is a brief description of myself...mature,smart,sexy, cerebral,
      passionate, loyal, caring, trustworthy,understanding young lady. I have had
      a variety of life experiences and I like to live life to the fullest! I am not
      a conventional person and I don't like to be placed in a box. I have always
      been a more progressive thinker but I was placed in this world ahead of my time.
      I have a very youthful appearance and although I will be flirty forty this year
      I am often told by people that have nothing to gain that I look like I am in
      my late twenties. I'll take that (smile) how about you?

    date_preferences_description: My ideal first date consists of inviting company, delectable food
        and an amazing atmosphere. Sexy music ( think Beres Hammond, Greggory Issac)
        and tropical drinks are a very welcome bonus (well maybe that should be the
        second date) ha-ha. I want to feel like the lady that I am. I love a gentleman
        (opening car doors, pulling out my chair);however, if that isn't your thing
        I will be a soldier and open my own door (I may not agree to a second date)
        :) Even though I am a forward thinker I like to indulge my sense of femininity
        in this ambiguous world of political correctness when interacting with the opposite
        sex (smile). In other words, by all means treat me like a lady. I am not looking
        for payment for the first date (or any date for that matter). I just want to
        show up,look beautiful,engage you in stimulating conversation, and have a great
        time (and not pay for or go dutch for dinner...old school). If we click and
        you decide to spoil me madly I will not object (smile).
