  general_info_description: "I like to enjoy all the good things in life and I'm not just talking
    about traveling, dining, or shopping. I love to laugh, joke around, and bring
    a smile to those around me, especially my loved ones. I'm a big believer that
    it doesn't matter where I am or what I'm doing as long as I have that genuine
    smile on my face that’s all that really matters.\r\n\r\nI love to practice aerobics
    such as: Zumba, Power Sculpt, and Cardio Kickboxing. I also enjoy Cooking, Dining
    out, Movies/Videos, Exploring new areas, going to the beach, Travel/Sightseeing,
    Volunteering, and Wine tasting.\r\n"

  general_info_description: Here is a brief description of myself...mature,smart,sexy, cerebral,
    passionate, loyal, caring, trustworthy,understanding young lady. I have had
    a variety of life experiences and I like to live life to the fullest! I am not
    a conventional person and I don't like to be placed in a box. I have always
    been a more progressive thinker but I was placed in this world ahead of my time.
    I have a very youthful appearance and although I will be flirty forty this year
    I am often told by people that have nothing to gain that I look like I am in
    my late twenties. I'll take that (smile) how about you?

  date_preferences_description: My ideal first date consists of inviting company, delectable food
    and an amazing atmosphere. Sexy music ( think Beres Hammond, Greggory Issac)
    and tropical drinks are a very welcome bonus (well maybe that should be the
    second date) ha-ha. I want to feel like the lady that I am. I love a gentleman
    (opening car doors, pulling out my chair);however, if that isn't your thing
    I will be a soldier and open my own door (I may not agree to a second date)
    :) Even though I am a forward thinker I like to indulge my sense of femininity
    in this ambiguous world of political correctness when interacting with the opposite
    sex (smile). In other words, by all means treat me like a lady. I am not looking
    for payment for the first date (or any date for that matter). I just want to
    show up,look beautiful,engage you in stimulating conversation, and have a great
    time (and not pay for or go dutch for dinner...old school). If we click and
    you decide to spoil me madly I will not object (smile).

    much. Definitely depends on chemistry! Other than that I would say the perfect
    date would be a mix between a nice dinner somewhere (preferably somewhere outdoors
    or by the water) and a night out with some music in the background and upbeat
    vibe (Say the shoreclub on a Friday).
